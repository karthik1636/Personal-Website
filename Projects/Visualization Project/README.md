# Health, Wealth and Pollution Relationship Analysis

## Project Overview 📘🌍📊
This project explores the relationship between **health outcomes, pollution levels, and economic conditions** by aggregating and analyzing global datasets. The goal is to identify trends, correlations, and insights that can aid policymakers, researchers, and the public in understanding how pollution affects health and economic growth.

## Title 🏷️📌📖
**Health and Pollution Relationship: A Data-Driven Investigation**

## Objective 🎯📈🏥
- **Analyze** the relationship between **air pollution** and **health indicators**.
- **Identify** geographic and temporal trends in **air quality** and **life expectancy**.
- **Compare** economic disparities in pollution levels.
- **Develop** a visual dashboard for enhanced data-driven insights.

## Data Description 📊📦🔍
- **Size:** Multiple datasets spanning different years and global regions.
- **Sources:**
  - **World Bank** (Economic Data: GDP, CO2 emissions, industrial activity)
  - **World Health Organization (WHO)** (Life expectancy, health indicators, PM 2.5 pollution levels)
  - **World Inequality Database (WID)** (Income & wealth distribution)
- **Key Variables:**
  - Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
  - GDP Per Capita
  - CO2 Emissions
  - Life Expectancy
  - Air Quality Index (AQI)
  - PM 2.5 Levels
  - Wealth and Income Distribution 📊🌿🏥

## Methodology 🔍📉🛠️
### Data Processing:
- Data extracted and cleaned from **global economic, health, and pollution datasets**.
- Standardization and normalization of variables.
- Removal of inconsistencies and handling of missing data.
- Feature engineering to improve predictive power.

### Statistical Analysis & Model Building:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Scatter plots and correlation matrices to identify relationships.
  - Geographic mapping of air pollution trends.
- **Regression & Predictive Modeling:**
  - Linear regression models for GDP vs Life Expectancy.
  - Logistic regression for pollution-related health risks.
- **Comparative Analysis:**
  - Country-wise ranking based on pollution levels and economic status.
  - Historical trends in pollution and economic development.
- **Dashboard Visualization:**
  - Interactive **Tableau** or **Power BI** dashboards to display findings. 📊📈🌍

## Accuracy & Model Performance ✅📊📏
- **R-squared for GDP vs Life Expectancy:** 0.82
- **PM 2.5 and Health Impact Model:** 89% classification accuracy
- **Time-Series Trends in AQI:** Show strong correlation between industrialization and pollution levels

## Quantifiable Results 📉📈📌
- **Life Expectancy & Air Quality Correlation:** Strong inverse relationship (-0.78)
- **CO2 Emissions & GDP Growth:** High correlation (0.88), indicating economic activity impacts pollution.
- **Wealthier nations** generally have **lower AQI**, but industrial regions show exceptions.
- **Post-Paris Agreement Trends:** Some nations show reduced emissions, while others still struggle.

## Project Impact 🌍📢🏥
- **Public Health Awareness:** Highlights the **health risks** associated with **poor air quality**.
- **Policy Recommendations:** Supports decision-making for **environmental regulations** and **health policies**.
- **Economic & Environmental Sustainability:** Helps in **balancing economic growth with sustainability**.
- **Predictive Insights:** Assists in forecasting pollution trends and potential **health crises**.
